"""Per-user data access — the seam that keeps multi-user from being a rewrite.

This module used to resolve FILE PATHS for a user (data/users/<id>/portfolios.json).
Now that storage is SQLite it resolves REPOSITORIES instead — but the shape of
the seam is unchanged, and that's the point: routes still ask "give me this
user's portfolios" and never know or care what's underneath.

Because every caller already threaded a user_id through this module, swapping
JSON files for SQL tables touched this file and the repository layer, and left
the routes almost untouched.
