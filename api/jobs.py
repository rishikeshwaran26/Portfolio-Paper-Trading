"""Background jobs: the price-alert checker and the periodic snapshot capture.

Why a thread and not Celery/APScheduler? For a single-user local tool, a daemon
thread with a sleep loop is the smallest thing that works, has zero extra
dependencies, and is easy to reason about. If this ever became a real service
you'd move to a proper scheduler (or a cron-invoked management command) — the
job FUNCTIONS below are written to be callable on their own precisely so that
swap stays easy.

Two things to be careful about, both handled here:

  1. THE RELOADER RUNS YOUR CODE TWICE. Flask's debug mode restarts the app in a
     child process, so a naively-started thread runs in both the parent and the
     child — double-firing every job. We only start when WERKZEUG_RUN_MAIN is
     set (the child) or the reloader is off.

  2. JOBS MUST SWEEP ALL USERS. The checker iterates paths.all_user_ids() rather
     than assuming one user. This is the same anti-hardcoding rule as the
     request path — it's why multi-user later isn't a rewrite.
