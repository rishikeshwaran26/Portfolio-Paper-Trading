"""The NSE stock universe — the full list of tradable symbols the screener scans.

Why this is separate from symbols.py
-------------------------------------
symbols.py is a *curated* ~165-name list for search/autocomplete: hand-picked,
bundled, always available offline. The screener needs the OPPOSITE — the whole
exchange (~1,900 equities), because a big intraday mover is often a small/mid-cap
you'd never think to type. So this module goes and gets the real, complete list.

Where the list comes from
-------------------------
NSE publishes the official equity master as a plain CSV:

    https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/equities/EQUITY_L.csv

Unlike NSE's quote API (aggressively IP-blocked, see engine/prices.py), this is a
static file on an archive host and usually downloads fine — especially from an
ordinary Indian residential connection, which is where you'll run the scan.

We cache it to disk so every scan doesn't re-download it, refresh weekly, and if
the download ever fails we fall back to the bundled symbols.py names so the
screener still runs (just over fewer stocks) instead of breaking.
