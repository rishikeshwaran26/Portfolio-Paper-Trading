"""SQLite schema and connection handling.

Why migrate off JSON
--------------------
JSON was right for Phase 1: readable, zero setup, easy to eyeball while the data
model was still moving. It stops being right once you want to *ask questions*.
Every analytics call currently loads every transaction of every strategy into
Python and filters in a loop. With SQL, "win rate by tag" is a GROUP BY that the
database does for us, and it stays fast as the journal grows.

The other thing JSON couldn't give us: safe concurrent writes. The background
worker and a web request could previously both read-modify-write the same file
and silently clobber each other (last writer wins). SQLite gives us real
transactions and row-level correctness instead.

Schema notes
------------
- `closed_lots` is its own TABLE, not a JSON blob on the sell. This is the
  single most important modelling decision here: closed lots are what journal
  analytics aggregates over ("avg holding days for winners", "P&L by tag"), and
  putting them in a real table is what makes those queries SQL instead of Python
  loops.

- `tags` IS stored as a JSON array in a TEXT column. A fully normalised
  tag/tag_link pair of tables would be more "correct", but tags here are a short
  list of free-text labels attached to one transaction, always read together
  with it, and never updated independently. The join cost isn't worth it. Where
  we DO need to query by tag we use json_each(), which SQLite provides.

- Money is REAL (float rupees), matching the engine. For a real money system
  you'd store integer paise to avoid float dust — noted as a known simplification.

- Foreign keys use ON DELETE CASCADE and we enable `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` per
  connection (SQLite defaults it OFF, which surprises people).

- WAL mode lets the background worker read while a request writes, instead of
  the two blocking each other.
